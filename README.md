## UI automation tests using Cypress

1. `yarn install` or `yarn` if you haven't already 

2. Create a `cypress.env.json` file from the `cypress.env.example.json` file -> simply run `yarn set:env:cypress` to get started.

3. To run UI automated tests interactively: `yarn test:cypress`

4. To run cypress tests headlessly (like we do in ci): `yarn test:e2e`
